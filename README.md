# Portfolio


## Intro

This Repo is designed to track my coding developement during my Bootcamp at Propulsion Accademy.
Since many exercises during this Bootcamp were designed for learning purposes only, it makes less sence to display all of them here. 
So here is a small collection of some of our exercises.

## Front End

* ReactJS
* React-Redux
* jQuery
* Vanilla JS



## Back End

* Java
* Spring
